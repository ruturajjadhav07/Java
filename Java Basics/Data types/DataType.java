// Two data types

// Primitive Data type

// Integer  -> byte, short, int, long
// Float -> double, float
// Character -> char
// Boolean -> true or false



// Non Primitive Data type
// They are called reference type
// strings, arrays, and classes


// Basically Primitive Data Types are the basic building blocks, such as int (for integers), float, double, String, char, boolean, byte, and short.
// and Non-Primitive Data Types are also called reference types, these include more complex structures like strings, arrays, and classes.
