# What is data type..?
*A data type is a classification of data that specifies which type of value a variable can hold or what kind of operations can be performed on that variable.*

## Types : 
### 1) Primitive Data Types : 
*These are the fundamental data types that are not derived from any other types. They include integer types (byte, short, int, long), floating types (float, double), character type (char), and boolean type (boolean).*

### 2) Non-Primitive Data Types : 
*They known as reference types, these are more complex data types that are derived from primitive types. They include strings, arrays, and classes.*
