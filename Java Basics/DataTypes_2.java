// Two data types

// Primitive Data type
// int, float, double, String, char, boolean, byte, short

// Non Primitive Data type
// They are called reference type
// strings, arrays, and classes


// Basically Primitive Data Types are the basic building blocks, such as int (for integers), float, double, String, char, boolean, byte, and short.
// and Non-Primitive Data Types are also called reference types, these include more complex structures like strings, arrays, and classes.
