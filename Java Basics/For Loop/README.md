# What is loop..?
*A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.*

## Types of for loop : 
### For Loop:

*The for loop is used to iterate over a given condition.*

*The loop has three parts: initialization (int i = 0), condition (i <= 10), and increment (i++).*

*It prints numbers from 0 to 10 using System.out.println(i).*


### Nested For Loop:

This example demonstrates a nested for loop where one loop is inside another.
The outer loop (i) runs from 0 to 3, and the inner loop (j) runs from 0 to 2.
It prints combinations of 'i' and 'j', resulting in a matrix-like pattern.

### For Each Loop:

The for-each loop is used to iterate over elements of an array or a collection.
It simplifies the syntax for iterating through elements.
Here, it prints each element of the lang array, which contains programming languages.
