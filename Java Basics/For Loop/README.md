# What is loop..?
*A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.*

## Types of for loop : 
### For Loop:

*The for loop is used to iterate over a given condition.*

*The loop has three parts: initialization (int i = 0), condition (i <= 10), and increment (i++).*

*It prints numbers from 0 to 10 using System.out.println(i).*


### Nested For Loop:

*A nested for loop in Java is a loop structure where one loop is placed inside another.*

*This creates a pattern of repeated execution, with the inner loop running multiple times for each iteration of the outer loop.* 

### For Each Loop:

*The for-each loop is used to iterate over elements of an array or a collection.*

*It simplifies the syntax for iterating through elements.*
