# What is If Else..?
*The if-else statement is a fundamental control flow structure in programming that allows you to make decisions in your code.*
## Syntax : 
*if (condition) {*

    *// Code to be executed if the condition is true*
    
*} else {*

    *// Code to be executed if the condition is false*
    
*}*

## Type of Statements : 
- ### if Statement :
  *The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.*

- ### else if Statement :
  *If the first if condition is false, it check the other condition with else if. If this else if condition is true, it execute its block of code. If none of the conditions are true, you can provide a default block of code to execute using else*



- ###  Nested if Statement :
  *The nested if statement involves putting an if statement inside another if statement. It's like having one decision inside another decision.*
