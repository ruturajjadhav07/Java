# What is Operators..?
### *operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data and perform various computations in a program.*
## *Below are types of operators :*

- ### Arithmetic Operators :
  * Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.*


- ### Assignment Operators :
  * Used to assign values to variables and perform the operation at the same time (e.g., +=, -=, *=, ...).*

    
- ### Comparison Operators :
  * Compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).*

- ### Logical Operators :
  * Combine boolean values using logical operations like AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).*
  * The Not actually reverses the things.*
  * Here T is true and F is false.*
