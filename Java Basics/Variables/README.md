# What is Variables..?

*Variables are used to store a specific value.*
*There are different types of variables.*
*String, int, float, double, boolean, and char.*
*These are also called data types.*


## Declaration and Initialization: 
*In Java, a variable is declared by specifying its data type (e.g., String, int, float, etc.) followed by a name (e.g., name, num, num1). Initialization is the process of giving a variable its initial value.*

## Data Types: 
*Different types of variables (or data types) are used for different kinds of values, such as text, whole numbers, numbers with decimals, single characters, and true/false values (boolean).*
