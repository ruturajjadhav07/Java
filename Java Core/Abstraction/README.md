# Abstraction
## What is abstraction..?
*"Abstraction means hiding the details and showing only the necessary features of an object to the outside world. When you want to declare an abstract method, you need to use the abstract keyword.* 

*Abstract methods belong only to abstract classes, and they are declared in abstract classes but not implemented there. Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, but abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses."*

## Syntax 
abstract class AbstractClass {

    public abstract void abstractMethod(); // Abstract method
    
}
