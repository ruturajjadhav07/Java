# What is error in java..?
*Error is Mistake, Unexpected result or Exception.Errors can occured by humans(illegal operation by users missing semicolon or parenthesis) or sometime by machine (i.e. logical error).*


## Types of Error : 
### 1) Compile-time Errors : 
*They are also known as syntax errors, these occur when the compiler compiles code that violates the rules of the Java language or does not matches the syntax.*
*Examples include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or using undefined variables.*


## 2) Runtime Error : 
*These are errors that occurs during the execution of the program.They are also referred to as exceptions.*
*Runtime errors can be further categorized into checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.*

- #### *Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time. The programmer is required to handle or declare these exceptions in the code. Examples include IOException, SQLException.*
  
- #### *Unchecked Exceptions: They are also known as runtime exceptions, these exceptions are not checked at compile time. They usually occur due to programming errors such as division by zero, accessing an array out of bounds, or invoking a method on a null object. Examples include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.*


## 3) Logical Error : 
*These errors occur when the program compiles and runs without any exceptions(error), but it produces incorrect results(Which is not expected). Logical errors are caused by flaws in the program's algorithm or logic.It is hard to find the mistake in logical error it requires proper and systematic understanding and debugging code.*
