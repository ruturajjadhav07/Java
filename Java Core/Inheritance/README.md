# Inheritance

## What is Inheritance?
##  The first class is know as base class or parent class. The class created from base class is called derived class or subclass.It is done by extend keyword.
## Important reminder :  Remember if we create class inside main file (class file name) first we need to create instance of main class file and then next of our created class.

### Just go step by step

*1) Single Level Inheritance : In single level, it's like having a parent and one child. The child gets all the cool stuff from the parent.*

*2) MutliLevel Inheritance : In MultiLevel it's like having a grandparent, parent, and child. Each level inherits from the one above.* 

*3) Hierarchical Inheritance : In Hierarchical it's like having one parent and two children. They share things from the same parent.*

*4) Multiple Inheritance : The Multiple is not supported by Java.*


# Benefits of Inheritance :
## *Code Reusability: Inheritance allows us to reuse code.*
## *Extensibility: New classes can be easily created based on existing classes, adding new functionalities or attributes without modifying the base class.*
