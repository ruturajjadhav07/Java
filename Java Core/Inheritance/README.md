# Inheritance
##  The first class is know as base class or parent class. The class created from base class is called derived class or subclass.It is done by extend keyword.
## Important reminder :  Remember if we create class inside main file (class file name) first we need to create instance of main class file and then next of our created class.
### Just go step by step

*1) Single Level Inheritance*

*2) MutliLevel Inheritance* 

*3) Hierarchical Inheritance*

*4) Multiple Inheritance*

## Code Reusability: Inheritance allows us to reuse code.
## Extensibility: New classes can be easily created based on existing classes, adding new functionalities or attributes without modifying the base class.
