# What is interface..?
*Basically interface is used to obtain or achive Abstraction.The methods in interface are default abstract even if we don't mention.*

*Therefore all methods in interface are public abstract.The variables declared inside interface are Final and Static.* 


*To implement interface by class we use implement keyword.*
*Syntax : class name implements interface name*

*and while one interface extends another interface*
*Syntax : interface name extends interface name*

## Remember : *Interface is not class*
