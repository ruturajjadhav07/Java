# What is interface..?
*Basically interface is used to obtain or achive Abstraction.The methods in interface are default abstract even if we don't mention.*

*Therefore all methods in interface are public abstract.The variables declared inside interface are Final and Static.* 
*To implement interface by class we use implement keyword.One class can implements many interfaces.*


## *Syntax : class name implements interface name*


### *In interface we cannot implement another interface.We extend it.*
## *Syntax : interface name extends interface name*

## Remember : *Interface is not class but the implementaion is somehow like class.*


# What is Functional interface : 
*Functional interface is interface which has only one method i.e. SAM (Single abstract method interface) or functional interface.*
*The abstract method of functional interface is called the functional interface*
*It is denoted by @FunctionalInterface*
### *We can only use lambda expression with functional interface.*
