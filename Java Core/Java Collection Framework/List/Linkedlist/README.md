# Linkedlist
*LinkedList is a class that implements the List interface in Java. It utilizes a doubly linked list structure to store elements. Each element is stored as a separate object (node) with references to both the previous and next nodes in the list.*

*LinkedList allows for the storage of duplicates of various data types. Elements stored in a LinkedList can be accessed sequentially or iteratively, as well as efficiently added or removed from the beginning, end, or middle of the list.*

*Unlike arrays, LinkedList does not require a contiguous block of memory, and the size of the LinkedList can vary dynamically as elements are added or removed.*
