# List

*The List interface in the Java Collection Framework represents an ordered collection of elements. Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements, and they maintain the order in which elements are inserted. This means that you can access elements in a list by their index position.*

*Lists are useful when you need to maintain a sequence of elements and access them by their position in that sequence. They provide methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements at specific positions.*

## Some of the classes used in List interface are
### 1. [ArrayList](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/List/ArrayList)
### 2. [LinkedList](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/List/Linkedlist)
### 3. [Stack](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/List/Stack)
### 4. [Vector](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/List/Vector)
