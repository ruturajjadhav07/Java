# Hashset

*HashSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface. It is used to store a collection of unique elements, meaning it does not allow duplicate values.* 

*HashSet uses a hash table for storage, which provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as add, remove, contains, and size, assuming the hash function disperses elements properly among the buckets.*

## There are many methods related to HashSet Here are most common that are used

### 1. add(E element):
* This method adds the specified element to the HashSet if it is not already present. If the element is already present, the set remains unchanged.

### 2. contains(Object o):
* This method returns true if the HashSet contains the specified element; otherwise, it returns false.

### 3. remove(Object o):
* This method removes the specified element from the HashSet if it is present. Returns true if the element was present and successfully removed; otherwise, returns false.

### 4. size():
* This method returns the number of elements in the HashSet.

### 5. isEmpty():
* This method returns true if the HashSet contains no elements; otherwise, returns false.

### 6. clear():
* This method removes all elements from the HashSet.
