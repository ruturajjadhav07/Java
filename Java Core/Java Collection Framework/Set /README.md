# Set

### *Sets are a fundamental part of the Java Collection Framework, providing a collection type that does not allow duplicate elements.It means the values should unique.*

### *In java the Set interface is implemented by several classes, such as [HashSet](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/Set%20/Hashset), [TreeSet](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/tree/main/Java%20Core/Java%20Collection%20Framework/Set%20/TreeSet), and LinkedHashSet, each with its own characteristics and behaviors.*
