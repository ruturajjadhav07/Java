# Public and Static Methods

## Public Method
*Public method can be accessed by anyone on program.*
*To use public method we need to create public method.*
*To access public method we need to create object from main class(java file name) and then we can access all other methods related to it.*

## Static Method
*It is same like Public method but you dont need to create a object to access Static method.*
*When static method is declared it is automatically related to main class*
