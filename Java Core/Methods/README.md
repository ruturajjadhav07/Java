# Public and Static Methods

## 1) Public Method
*Public method can be accessed by anyone on program.*

*To use public method we need to declare method as public.*

*To access public method we need to create object from main class(java file name) and then we can access all other methods related to it.*

## 2) Static Method
*It is same like Public method but you dont need to create a object to access Static method.*

*When static method is declared it is automatically related to main class.*

## 3) Method Overloading
*Method Overloading is useful when we have multiple methods with same name in class.*

*It can have same method name but different number of parameters inside it.*

*if two methods name, data type and number of parameters are same it will give error.*

*Therefore it should have different number of parameters for every method created with same data type and name.*
