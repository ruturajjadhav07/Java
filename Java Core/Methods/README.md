# Methods

## What is method?
*In Java a method is a block of code that performs a specific task or action.*
*Methods are used to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces, making the code modular and easier to understand.*

## 1) [Public Method](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Methods/PublicMethod.java)
*Public method can be accessed by anyone on program.*

*To use public method we need to declare method as public.*

*To access public method we need to create object from main class(java file name) and then we can access all other methods related to it.*

## 2) [Static Method](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Methods/StaticMethod.java)
*It is same like Public method but you dont need to create a object to access Static method.*

*When static method is declared it is automatically related to main class.*

## 3) [Method Overloading](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Methods/MethodOverloading.java)
*Method Overloading is useful when we have multiple methods with same name in class.*

*It can have same method name but different number of parameters inside it.*

*if two methods name, data type and number of parameters are same it will give error.*

*Therefore it should have different number of parameters for every method created with same data type and name.*

*Method Overloading is used for compile time polymorphism*

## 4) [Method Overriding](https://github.com/ruturajjadhav07/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Methods/methodOverriding.java)
*Method overriding is used to over ride the method which has same name that is inherited from parent class*

*Method Overriding is used for runtime polymorphism.*


## Benefits of Method
*1. Code Reusability*

*2. Modularity*

*3. Parameterization : can pass parameters*

*4. Encapsulation*
