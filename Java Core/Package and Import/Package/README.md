# What is package..?
*It is folder structure in java.It is a keyword.The package starter has to be written at the forst line of program.*

*We cannot write anything before package statement.Every program can have at max one package statement package.*

*Packages are required for better maintainence and enhancement.*

## Example 
*Consider a folder path(C:/random-folder/src/com/example/Hello.java).There is Hello.java file.*
So the package will be.

package com.example;               *(This is package name)*

public class Hello {

    public static void sayHello() {

        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    
    }

}
