# **About Java.**

**Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.**

**Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications.**

**Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language.**

**Java works on different platform and it is platform-independent language.**

*Java is also called as WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).*

## What is JVM..?
- *JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.*
- *It provides a runtime environment for Java applications to run independently of the underlying hardware and operating system.*
- *Java Compiler(javac) is used to convert the java file in byte code.*
- *The extension for byte class is .class*
- *When you compile the java file using javac the class file is generated.*

## What is JRE..?
- *JRE is known as Java Runtime Environment.*
- *JRE is a software package that includes the JVM, libraries, and other components necessary for running Java applications.*
- *It does not contain development tools like compilers; it's designed for end-users to run Java applications.*
- *and one more JVM is part of jre*

## What is JDK..?
- *JDK is a comprehensive software development kit for Java that includes the JRE, development tools (like compilers and debuggers), and additional libraries.*
- *It consist on JVM and JRE*
- *It is used by developers to create, compile, and debug Java applications.*
